This page is used to create a portfolio for myself. It is deployed in the same web address as the name of this repository.

I began by creating three different html files: index.html, portfolio.html, and contact.html.

Each page has a different purpose. The index page serves as a home screen, where I have added an about me section. In the future I would like to add links to social media and pictures of myself.

The portfolio page has images that show the projects I have completed. Currently the images are just placeholders, but I will add more images as I complete my projects.

The contact page is meant as a way for someone to contact me by leaving their email, name, and message. The form is just a template, and will be updated to store information later.
