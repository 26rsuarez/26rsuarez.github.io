      <p class="text-wrap">My name is Raunel Suarez-Magana. I graduated from University of Texas at Austin with a degree in Mathematics. Ever since I was young, Math has been one of my passions.
        After graduating I worked as a math teacher for 3.5 years. I enjoyed teaching and inspiring other students to enjoy math. Being a teacher has its perks, but I wanted to continue learning and trying something new.

        In college, I took a class on the basics of python. During quarantine I spent more time learning about data science. The ways python was used to solve problems fascinated me. I followed the python rabbit hole, which led me to creating websites using 
        django and flask. I wanted to continue learning about front end and back end programming so I signed up for the UT coding bootcamp.
        I am currently learning how to be a fullstack programmer. I enjoy learning new languages and how math is incorporated into each one.
        I hope to transition into a career in this field soon.
